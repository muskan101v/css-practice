        a new accounting system uses dummy data to ensure its bookings are
        stored correctly before inputting live accounts. You can think of dummy
        data like a car crash dummy — you hope nothing bad happens to it while
        testing, but if something bad does happen, you can fix the problem with
        no negative impact on your valuable data assets. Make Sure You Know Your
        Dummy Data A classic slip-up for new analysts is not knowing dummy data
        from real data, which be confusing (and embarrassing) when you’re
        working fast on a project with others. That’s because in some cases
        dummy data can “look” real, so make sure to ensure everyone involved is
        aware when dummy data is active. Don’t forget, you can access the 67
        data skill and concepts checklist for free to ensure you’ve got your
        bases covered. Examples of Dummy Data Analysts use dummy data in two
        primary contexts (we’ll look at a third later): testing new programs and
        testing modifications on existing program. Let’s look at an example of
        each below. Testing New Programs Imagine you own a big e-commerce
        website that sells watches in bulk. Your company is called Batch Watch —
        it’s your baby. One of the biggest assets the company has is the data it
        collects on vendors, its products, and customers. When you started the
        company, you didn’t have much cash to spend on an expensive database
        program, so you took the first inexpensive option that came your way.
        Unfortunately, this means your data is not well-modeled, and you’re not
        really sure how that initial data program’s technical skeleton is
        structured.
